# My Neovim IDE Configuration

This is a modern, Lua-based Neovim configuration designed to function as a lightweight yet powerful, IDE-like editor. It is built to be fast, aesthetically pleasing, and highly functional for modern development workflows.

It uses `lazy.nvim` for package management, ensuring that plugins are loaded efficiently.

## Features

*   üì¶ **Plugin Management:** Automatically handles installation and updates via `lazy.nvim`.
*   üöÄ **Fast Startup:** Plugins are lazy-loaded to keep startup times minimal.
*   ‚ú® **Beautiful UI:** A clean dashboard, status line, and the popular Tokyo Night theme.
*   üß† **Code Intelligence:** Full LSP support for diagnostics, code actions, and go-to-definition via `lsp-zero`.
*   ü§ñ **Powerful Autocompletion:** State-of-the-art completion engine powered by `nvim-cmp`.
*   üîç **Fuzzy Finding:** Quickly find files, text, buffers, and more with `Telescope`.
*   üå≥ **File Explorer:** A familiar sidebar file tree with `nvim-tree`.
*   ‚úÖ **Git Integration:** See git diffs and status directly in the editor with `gitsigns`.
*   üîß **Easy to Customize:** The configuration is split into logical files, making it easy to add or change plugins and keymaps.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system.

1.  **Neovim v0.9.0+**: Required for the latest Lua API features.
2.  **Git**: Required by `lazy.nvim` to download and manage plugins.
3.  **A Nerd Font**: **This is essential for icons to render correctly.**
    *   Download and install a font like [FiraCode Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) or [JetBrainsMono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).
    *   **Configure your terminal emulator to use the installed Nerd Font.**
4.  **Build Tools**: Required for compiling some plugins and Treesitter parsers.
    *   **Linux/macOS**: `gcc`, `make`, `unzip`.
    *   **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools and `make` (e.g., via `winget install GnuWin32.Make`).
5.  **`ripgrep`**: A required dependency for Telescope's `live_grep` (find text in project).
    *   Install it via your system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install ripgrep`, `brew install ripgrep`).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the configuration:**
    ```bash
    # Backup your existing config first!
    # mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak

    git clone <your-repo-url> ~/.config/nvim
    ```
    *(If you don't have this in a git repo, simply copy the files into `~/.config/nvim`)*

2.  **Start Neovim:**
    ```bash
    nvim
    ```
    On the first launch, `lazy.nvim` will automatically open and start installing all the plugins. This may take a minute.

3.  **Restart Neovim:**
    After the installation is complete, close and restart Neovim. You should be greeted by the Alpha dashboard.

## Post-Installation: Setting up Language Servers

This configuration sets up the LSP framework, but you need to install the language servers for the languages you use. We use `mason.nvim` for this.

1.  Run the command `:Mason` inside Neovim.
2.  A window will pop up. Find the language server you need (e.g., `lua_ls` for Lua, `pyright` for Python, `typescript-language-server` for TS/JS).
3.  Press `i` to install it.
4.  Restart Neovim. The language server will now automatically attach when you open a relevant file, providing full IDE features.
